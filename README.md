# graphicApp

Android app that displays the home run leader in a bar graph and the home run totals of the last 25 years in a line graph. 

Initially I was hoping to scrape data from baseball-reference.com through the app but connecting to the internet was causing me a lot of issues. I attempted to use the Async class to connect to the internet and then use JSoup to parse the data from the data. Instead I inputted the data from baseball-reference into separate text files and read the files and inputted the data into graphs. The graphs I used are from the library MPAndroidCharts.
